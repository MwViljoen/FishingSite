            <p>
              Fresh water fishing is probably the easiest to learn between the two and I believe it is the best start for beginers.
              It teaches you the basics about fishing knots, how to cast, what bait to use, and it gives you a general idea of
              the ins and outs of fishing.
              Fresh water fisherman tend to have smaller rods, hooks, reels and catch smaller fish compared to ocean fishermen.
              Although fresh water fishing is easier between the two, there are still very big fresh water fish that can be
              caught. Don't misunderstand,
              If you are after big fish, fresh water fishing can become very challanging and it takes a lot of practice and
              experience to know how, where and when
              to catch the big fish.<br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <h4>Pros about fresh water fishing:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintanance is lower than it is for salt water fishing.</li>
              <li>No need for Big- Rods, Reels, Sinkers, Lures and Hooks</li>
              <li>You don't always need a boat to get to the bigger fish!</li>
              <li>Fresh water fish are not in specific places, they are everywhere in dams and rivers.</li>
              <li>It is much safer for kids & adults than the ocean.</li>
              <li>There is still a big variety of fish to catch.</li>
              <li>There are many other methods of fishing such as fly fishing, bait fishing and lure fishing. All with their own species of fish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Many of us live inland and only seldomly go on vacations to see the great ocean. Fishing in the ocean is a
              challenging feat.
              Compared to fresh water fishing, there is much to know in order to be a succesfull salt water fisherman.
              Now it matters where you cast, what bait you use,
              how you set up your rigs, what equipment you use and how you put your bait on the hooks!. These fish are no
              joke. THEY GET BIGGG!
              If you dont know how to do salt water fishing yet and you are new, no worries! Don't be afraid to ask other
              fishermen for advice. They all had to start somewhere between knowing and not knowing, and they will give you the best
              advice, especially locals. Otherwise, if you are a person who prefers being prepared, you can also watch
              youtube videos that I will link below on fishing and there are many books and manuals for all types of fishing that you can read.<br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <h4>Pros about salt water fishing:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>You catch waaaayyyyyy BIGGGERRR fish!!!</li>
              <li>There are plenty of species to catch.</li>
              <li>You can catch from the rocks, straight from the beach or go deep sea fishing.</li>
              <li>Boats, yes, who doesn't like going fishing on a boat and see all sorts of creatures like whales,
                sharks and dolphins if you are lucky.</li>
              <li>Beach, for those of us not living close to shore. It is the best feeling to breath in the air from the
                ocean and stick our bear feet into the sand.</li>
              <li>These fish can put up a good hour's fight, which makes the catch feel much more exilirating.</li>

            <h2 class="mof-heading mof-heading-spacing" id="methods">Fishing Methods</h2>
            <p>
              There are mainly two fishing methods, One is using live bait (left picture above) and the other is using
              artificial bait (right picture above). Both of these methods are used in either
              fresh water or salt water fishing. The only difference between salt and fresh water's live and
              artificial baits are the size and type of the bait you use.
            </p>
            <p>
              For fresh water, the artificial baits are normaly small and can fit in the palm of your hand, while salt
              water artificial baits can be as big as two palm sizes or more.
              In salt water it really depends on the size of fish you want to catch, in fact you can catch HUGE fish
              with small artificial bait if you are really lucky and get a good hook.
              Even though you can catch big fish with small hooks, it does not work the other way around, it's nearly
              impossible to catch small fish with hooks that are too big, so choose wisely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artificial bait is normally meant to be moving bait, it acts and moves as if it were a real small fish 
              or bug by casting it in and continuously reeling it in again and again. If you are on a boat you
              don't have to reel in so much, you can cast and set the boat to the right speed. This will allow the artificial bait
              to move at the boat's speed, this method is
              used mainly for deep sea fishing when you are trying to catch big fish like tuna or marlins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Live bait, on the other hand, is stationary. Where you throw it is where it stays and only time will tell
              when and if the excitement will arrive.
              Fresh water live bait can be worms, seeds, roots, insects, frogs and much more. Some of the bait is even
              home made like bread and dough.

            <p>
              If you are new to fishing, then the first thing you need do is pick what type of fishing you want to do and what fish
              you want to catch. Only after you have decided on where, what fish, how and with what you want to catch the fish, can you buy what you need.
              Do some research first and talk to someone who can give you an idea before you buy the wrong equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              All equipment narrows down to a fishing rod, a reel, fishing line, swivels, hooks, sinkers and floaties. With these you can pretty much catch anywhere,
              Additionally you will need a knife or scissors, bait, a net, a cooler and a bag or tackle box. Instead of me typing everything I know here in detail,
              There will be a table below with links to all the information you need.
            </p>
            <p>
              These links will help you get started or teach you something new and there are many other ways of preparing and learning. Just don't go unprepared and remember to have fun!
              Don't be scared to make mistakes and learn, even fisherman with years of experience still lose fish and struggle sometimes. It is, afterall, how we all started fishing...

<!--i know my website is not great, but in this section i attempted to use code from sites that was already written and just altered it to my liking
in the future i will attempt to use a template and see how great i can make my page!!, but for now just to practice and learn
