                        Hi there, my name is Willem and welcome to my corner of the woods. I grew up on my parents farm and times were often tough,
                        so there wasn't always money for fancy cars and fancy toys etc. We did however have fishing rods! As a farmer's son I had
                        little time to myself to do what I want or to do the things that most kids do. I had plenty of chores and always had to carry 
                        my weight. If it wasn't school work that needs doing, it was farming work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-card-1-text animate__animated animate__backInLeft"> <!--animations from another site link is below-->
                        Time to time, however, my father gave me some time off to do anything I wanted, so I went fishing with my Grandfather who loves 
                        fishing as much as I do! Everything I know about fishing I learned from him. Fishing has tought me many things such as 
                        patience, how important it is to spend time with family and that there is no better way to learn things than by teaching yourself. 
                        With all that said, I really hope that my website will inspire and encourage you to go do a little fishing.</br>

                        Okay, so, I've told you about my younger days on the farm and how hard I worked. Luckily it paid off! My Father tought me 
                        how to be a hard worker just as he was and that has stuck with me all my life. After School my father told me: "No matter 
                        what, I will pay for your studies so that you won't struggle or have any dept." and he kept true to his promise.

                        I studied Engineering for five long years to get my Diploma and Bachelors. Yes, I am a qualified Mechatronic Engineer! For 
                        3 years throughout my professional career I worked as an Automation Engineer for various companies. During those three years, 
                        though, I eventually I lost my passion for Engineering and so I searched for something similar to it, but with less travelling, 
                        more family time and more me time.

                        One day, a friend who studied Engineering with me wanted to meet up. We talked about our careers and felt we had jobs but
                        no passions for what we were doing, so  I guess you could say that we were "in the same boat". Both of us decided on finding someting new to do and we started to do free courses on
                        Web Development. I enjoyed it very much and so I enrolled at a Web Development bootcamp. So now I am studying Web Development 
                        and thus this Website was born!</br>

<!-- Here I spent more time playing with sass and css, also to test how to use divs properly.
It helped me a lot to understand where to have the content in html and where not to.
yet again this about me page was purely for learning and not so much for making it look amazing
I did however try to make it look better by using all my knowledge this far.

I used the following sources to make the about page

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/ used for the buttons
https://animate.style/#documentation mainly to play with animations
https://coolors.co/palettes/trending used for good color choices
